# Image Compression Web

This is a simple web application built using Flask framework that allows users to compress images. The application accepts an image file from the user, compresses it using JPEG optimization with a quality setting of 30, and returns the compressed image for download.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install flask pillow
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the Flask application by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

   The web application will start running on the local development server.

3. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the image compression web interface.

4. Choose an image file using the provided file input field.

5. Click the "Compress" button to initiate the compression process.

6. Once the compression is complete, the compressed image will be downloaded automatically.

## Code Overview

- The Flask application is created using the `Flask` class from the `flask` module.

- The root route (`'/'`) serves the `index.html` file, which contains the web interface for image compression.

- The `/compress` route handles the compression process. It accepts a POST request with an image file, compresses the image using the `PIL` library, and returns the compressed image for download.

- The `send_file` function from Flask is used to send the compressed image as a response.

- The `app.run()` statement starts the Flask development server.

## Customize

You can customize the application according to your requirements. Here are some possible modifications:

- Modify the `index.html` file to change the appearance and layout of the web interface.

- Adjust the compression quality by modifying the `quality` parameter in the `picture.save()` function. Higher values (e.g., 70) result in better quality but larger file sizes.

- Customize the MIME type and download filename by modifying the `mimetype` and `download_name` parameters in the `send_file` function.

- Add additional error handling or validation logic to handle different scenarios.
